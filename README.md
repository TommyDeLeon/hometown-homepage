# 🏡 Project Documentation: Crafting a Vibrant Homepage for Taytay 🎉

Welcome to my project! This is not just a simple, single-page website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a vibrant showcase of the town of Taytay, Rizal in the Philippines, highlighting its rich history, thriving fashion industry, and local attractions. This webpage is my tribute to my hometown, a canvas where I paint its unique features, attractions, and culture. Let's dive in! 😊

## 🛠️ Technology Used
This project is a beautiful blend of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. HTML is our canvas, structuring the content of the webpage, while CSS is our palette, styling the webpage to perfection. JavaScript is our magic wand, adding interactivity to the website and making it come alive.

## 🎓 Lessons Learned
This project was a deep dive into the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We learned how to:
- Structure a single-page website using HTML 📝
- Style a website using CSS, including gradients, borders, and custom fonts 🎨
- Add interactivity to a website using JavaScript, specifically listening for scroll events and changing the active section of the website based on the scroll direction 🖱️

## 🎨 What Was Created
We crafted a single-page website with three sections, each telling a different story about Taytay, Rizal. The sections become active based on the user's scroll direction, providing a unique and engaging navigation experience.

## 💡 Ideas to Make It Better
### Add more interactivity:
Our website is currently static. Adding animations or transitions when changing sections with JavaScript could make it come alive. 🖱️
### Improve accessibility:
Let's ensure our website is accessible to all users. This could include adding alt text to images, improving color contrast, and ensuring all functionality can be accessed using a keyboard. 🌐
### Make it responsive:
Let's make our website adaptable to different screen sizes. Currently, it has a fixed size, which may not look good on all screens. Let's make Taytay accessible to everyone, regardless of their device! 📱
